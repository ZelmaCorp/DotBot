## Core Design Principles

### 1. Agent-First Architecture

**Principle**: Agents are responsible for creating extrinsics, not the execution engine.

**Why?**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Agent knows the business logic (what to build), executioner knows the execution logic (how to execute)
- **Scalability**: Adding a new agent doesn't require modifying the executioner
- **Testability**: Agents can be tested independently by verifying extrinsic creation
- **Reusability**: Agents can be used by any execution environment

**What This Means:**
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: Agent creates extrinsic
const result = await agent.transfer({ ... });
const extrinsic = result.extrinsic; // Ready to sign!
await executioner.execute(result);

// ❌ WRONG: Executioner creates extrinsic from metadata
const result = await agent.transfer({ ... });
const metadata = result.metadata; // Just data
// Executioner rebuilds extrinsic (bad - agent logic in executioner)
```

**History**: We initially tried having agents return metadata and letting the executioner build extrinsics. This failed because:
- Executioner became agent-specific (doesn't scale)
- Registry mismatches caused errors
- Violates single responsibility principle

(Reverted to agent-first: January 2026, see ARCHITECTURE_REVERSION_COMPLETE.md)

---

### 2. Production-Safe by Default

**Principle**: All operations should work reliably across different runtime versions and chains.

**Why?**
- Polkadot runtimes evolve (methods get added/deprecated)
- Different chains have different capabilities
- Users shouldn't face cryptic errors
- Automatic fallbacks prevent breakage

**Implementation:**
- Runtime capability detection before extrinsic creation
- Automatic fallbacks (transferKeepAlive → transferAllowDeath → transfer)
- Comprehensive error messages
- Simulation before execution

**Example:**
```typescript
// Capability detection
const capabilities = await detectTransferCapabilities(api);

// Safe extrinsic building with fallbacks
const result = buildSafeTransferExtrinsic(api, params, capabilities);
// Automatically selects best available method
```

---

### 3. Pluggable Components

**Principle**: Key components should be replaceable without changing core logic.

**Why?**
- Different environments have different constraints (browser vs terminal vs backend)
- Testing requires mock implementations
- Future extensibility

**Pluggable Components:**
- **Signers**: BrowserWalletSigner, KeyringSigner, CustomSigner
- **RPC Providers**: Multiple endpoints with automatic failover
- **Simulation**: Chopsticks (optional), can be replaced with dry-run

---

### 4. Explicit Chain Selection

**Principle**: Never infer which chain to use based on balance or heuristics. Always explicit.

**Why?**
- Post-migration, DOT exists on both Relay Chain and Asset Hub
- Inferring from balance is unreliable and confusing
- User intent must drive chain selection
- Prevents accidental wrong-chain operations

**Decision Record**: Decision 1 (see below)

---

## Module Structure

### Agents (`frontend/src/lib/agents/`)

**Purpose**: Create production-safe extrinsics for specific operations.

**Structure:**
```
agents/
├── baseAgent.ts              # Base class with common utilities
├── types.ts                  # Shared agent interfaces
└── asset-transfer/           # Asset transfer agent
    ├── agent.ts              # Main agent implementation
    ├── types.ts              # Agent-specific types
    └── utils/                # Production-safe utilities
        ├── transferCapabilities.ts   # Runtime capability detection
        ├── safeExtrinsicBuilder.ts  # Extrinsic creation with fallbacks
        ├── capabilityDetectors.ts   # Method detection helpers
        ├── addressEncoder.ts        # SS58 address encoding
        ├── addressValidation.ts     # Address format validation
        ├── amountNormalizer.ts      # Amount conversion (human → Planck)
        ├── amountParser.ts          # Amount parsing utilities
        └── balanceValidator.ts      # Balance validation helpers
```

**Key Classes:**
- **BaseAgent**: Provides common functionality (address validation, balance checks, dry-run)
- **AssetTransferAgent**: Handles DOT/token transfers across chains

**Responsibilities:**
- Validate user input
- Detect runtime capabilities
- Create production-safe extrinsics
- Return standardized AgentResult
- Optionally dry-run with Chopsticks

---

### Execution Engine (`frontend/src/lib/executionEngine/`)

**Purpose**: Execute extrinsics created by agents.

**Structure:**
```
executionEngine/
├── executioner.ts           # Main execution coordinator
├── executionArray.ts        # Transaction queue management
├── orchestrator.ts          # Execution plan orchestration
├── system.ts                # ExecutionSystem (high-level API)
├── utils.ts                 # Execution utilities
├── types.ts                 # Execution-related types
├── simulation/              # Pre-execution simulation
│   └── executionSimulator.ts
├── signing/                 # Transaction signing
│   └── executionSigner.ts
├── broadcasting/            # Network broadcasting
│   └── executionBroadcaster.ts
└── signers/                 # Signer implementations
    ├── browserSigner.ts     # Browser wallet signer
    ├── keyringSigner.ts     # Keyring signer (CLI/backend)
    └── types.ts             # Signer types
```

**Flow:**
1. **Simulation**: Validate with Chopsticks (optional)
   - If enabled: Items start as `'pending'`, simulation runs before signing
   - If disabled: Items start as `'ready'`, execution proceeds directly to signing
2. **Signing**: Get user approval and sign
3. **Broadcasting**: Send to network
4. **Monitoring**: Wait for finalization

**Key Principle**: Executioner is **generic** - it doesn't know about specific agents. It only knows how to:
- Optionally simulate any extrinsic (if simulation enabled)
- Sign any extrinsic
- Broadcast any extrinsic
- Monitor any transaction

**Status Initialization:**
- Items initialize with status based on simulation setting:
  - `'pending'` when simulation enabled (will be simulated first)
  - `'ready'` when simulation disabled (ready for immediate signing)
- This ensures UI correctly reflects execution flow

---

### Services (`frontend/src/lib/services/`)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure services.

**Key Services:**
- **RpcManager**: Multi-endpoint management with health monitoring, failover, and **network-awareness**
- **Chopsticks**: Runtime simulation for pre-execution validation (network-configurable)

**RpcManager Network Features:**
- Network-scoped storage keys (health tracking isolated per network)
- Factory functions for easy network-specific instantiation
- Pre-configured endpoint lists for Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend

---

### Network System (`frontend/src/lib/prompts/system/knowledge/`)

**Purpose**: Provide network-aware configuration and LLM context for multi-network support.

**Structure:**
```
prompts/system/knowledge/
├── types.ts                    # Network types and metadata
├── networkUtils.ts             # Network utility functions (20+)
├── index.ts                    # Centralized exports
├── dotKnowledge.ts             # Polkadot-specific information
└── westendKnowledge.ts         # Westend testnet information
```

**Key Types:**
- **Network**: Type-safe union (`'polkadot' | 'kusama' | 'westend'`)
- **NetworkMetadata**: Centralized network configuration (tokens, decimals, SS58, RPC endpoints, colors)
- **NETWORK_CONFIG**: Complete metadata for all supported networks

**Current Support:**
- ✅ Polkadot: Full support (knowledge base + infrastructure)
- ✅ Westend: Full support (knowledge base + infrastructure)
- ⚠️ Kusama: Partial support (infrastructure only, knowledge base TODO)

**Key Functions:**
- `getNetworkMetadata(network)` - Get all configuration for a network
- `detectNetworkFromChainName(chainName)` - Auto-detect network from chain info
- `getNetworkTokenSymbol(network)` - Get native token symbol (DOT/KSM/WND)
- `isTestnet(network)` - Check if network is testnet
- `getRelayChainEndpoints(network)` - Get Relay Chain RPC endpoints
- `getAssetHubEndpoints(network)` - Get Asset Hub RPC endpoints
- `getKnowledgeBaseForNetwork(network)` - Load network-specific knowledge
- `formatKnowledgeBaseForNetwork(network)` - Format knowledge for LLM context

**Responsibilities:**
- Provide type-safe network identifiers
- Centralize network configuration
- Supply network-specific knowledge to LLM
- Enable network detection from chain metadata
- Support future network additions (Kusama, etc.)

**Design Principle**: Networks are first-class concepts with dedicated configuration, not just string identifiers.

---

### Chat System (`frontend/src/lib/`)

**Purpose**: Manage conversation instances with execution flow tracking and environment isolation.

**Structure:**
```
lib/
├── chatInstance.ts              # ChatInstance class (conversation + execution state)
├── chatInstanceManager.ts       # Chat lifecycle management
├── types/chatInstance.ts        # Chat-related types
└── storage/chatStorage.ts       # Storage abstraction layer
```

**Key Concepts:**

1. **ChatInstance (Class)**
   - Encapsulates a single conversation
   - Bound to an environment (`'mainnet'` | `'testnet'`)
   - Contains temporal message history (`ConversationItem[]`)
   - Manages multiple ExecutionArrays (Map<id, ExecutionArray>)
   - Handles persistence and lifecycle

2. **ConversationItem** (formerly ChatMessage)
   - Union type for all conversation elements:
     - `TextMessage` - User/bot text messages
     - `ExecutionMessage` - Blockchain operations (embeds ExecutionArrayState)
     - `SystemMessage` - System notifications
     - `KnowledgeRequestMessage` / `KnowledgeResponseMessage`
     - `SearchRequestMessage` / `SearchResponseMessage`
   - Enables temporal ordering of text and execution flows

3. **Environment Isolation**
   - `mainnet`: Production environment (Polkadot, Kusama)
   - `testnet`: Testing environment (Westend)
   - Chat instances cannot mix environments
   - Switching environment creates new chat instance

4. **Multiple Execution Flows**
   - Each conversation can have multiple independent ExecutionArrays
   - Each ExecutionArray has unique ID
   - Execution flows appear inline in conversation timeline
   - Can be interacted with independently

**Responsibilities:**
- Maintain conversation history with execution state
- Persist chat instances to storage
- Generate chat titles automatically
- Subscribe to execution updates
- Validate environment/network compatibility

**Design Principle**: Conversations are first-class entities that own their execution state, not just message logs.

---

### Frontend Components (`frontend/src/components/`)

**Purpose**: React UI components for DotBot interface.

**Key Components:**

1. **Environment Management**
   - `EnvironmentBadge` - Visual indicator for current environment (mainnet/testnet)
   - `EnvironmentSwitch` - Toggle between mainnet and testnet environments
   - Integrated with DotBot's `switchEnvironment()` method

2. **Chat Interface**
   - `ChatHistory` - List of previous conversations with search capability
   - `Message` - Individual message component with avatar, name, date, and content
   - Supports both user and bot messages with proper styling

3. **Execution Flow**
   - `ExecutionFlow` - Visual representation of ExecutionArray
   - Shows transaction steps, status, and progress
   - "Accept & Start" button for user approval
   - Respects simulation setting (shows/hides simulation UI)

4. **Wallet Integration**
   - `WalletModal` - Wallet connection and account management
   - `WalletAccountItem` - Individual account display
   - `WalletAccountsList` - List of available accounts
   - `WalletConnectedState` - Connected wallet state display
   - `WalletEmptyState` - Empty state when no wallet connected

**Hooks:**
- `useDebounce` - Debounces function calls (used for Connect button to prevent rapid clicks)
- `useDebouncedClick` - Specialized hook for debouncing click handlers

**Styling:**
- Theme-aware CSS variables for light/dark mode
- Environment-specific styling (amber for testnet in light mode)
- Message bubble styling with proper border-radius and colors
- Responsive design considerations

**Design Principles:**
- Components are environment-aware
- UI reflects simulation state correctly
- Clear visual separation between mainnet and testnet
- User approval required before execution

---

### Data Management (`frontend/src/lib/`)

**Purpose**: GDPR-compliant data management and storage abstraction.

**Structure:**
```
lib/
├── dataManager.ts              # GDPR operations (export, delete, verify)
└── storage/chatStorage.ts      # Storage abstraction
```

**Key Components:**

1. **DataManager**
   - `exportAllData()` - Complete data export (JSON)
   - `exportAndDownload()` - Export with browser download
   - `nukeAllData()` - Complete data deletion (GDPR compliance)
   - `verifyDataCleared()` - Confirm deletion
   - Granular deletion: chat instances, RPC health, preferences, wallet cache

2. **Storage Abstraction (`IChatStorage`)**
   - Interface for chat persistence
   - Implementations:
     - `LocalStorageChatStorage` - Browser localStorage (current default)
     - `ApiChatStorage` - External database (ready for future)
     - `HybridChatStorage` - Offline-first with API sync
   - All operations async (ready for network requests)

3. **STORAGE_KEYS**
   - Centralized storage key enum
   - Keys scoped by data type (chats, RPC, preferences, etc.)
   - Enables complete data discovery and deletion

**Responsibilities:**
- GDPR right to erasure (complete data deletion)
- GDPR right to data portability (export)
- Storage backend abstraction
- Data integrity verification
- Privacy compliance

**Design Principle**: Data management is centralized, auditable, and privacy-first.

## Design Decisions

### Decision 1: Explicit Chain Selection for DOT Transfers

**Context:**
- November 2025: DOT balances migrated from Relay Chain → Asset Hub
- Users now have DOT on Asset Hub (primary) and optionally Relay Chain (staking/governance)
- Inferring chain from balance is unreliable

**Decision:**
Asset transfer agent requires explicit `chain` parameter (`'assetHub'` or `'relay'`).

**Rationale:**
1. **User Intent**: User knows which chain they want to use
2. **Predictability**: No surprises from heuristics
3. **Correctness**: Prevents wrong-chain operations
4. **Clarity**: API is explicit and self-documenting

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. ❌ **Balance-based inference**: Check both chains, use one with higher balance
   - Problem: What if user wants to transfer from lower-balance chain?
   - Problem: Extra RPC calls
   - Problem: Confusing behavior
   
2. ❌ **Default to Asset Hub**: Always use Asset Hub unless specified
   - Problem: Doesn't work for Relay Chain staking/governance operations
   - Problem: Still implicit

3. ✅ **Explicit parameter**: Require `chain` in request
   - Clear and predictable
   - No guessing
   - Matches user's mental model

**Consequences:**
- API requires additional parameter (minor inconvenience)
- Frontend must expose chain selection UI
- No ambiguity in behavior
- Future-proof as ecosystem evolves

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// User must specify chain
await agent.transfer({
  sender: address,
  recipient: address,
  amount: '10',
  chain: 'assetHub',  // Required!
  keepAlive: true
});
```

(Updated: January 2026)

---

### Decision 2: Agent Creates Extrinsic (Not Executioner)

**Context:**
- Initial implementation had executioner rebuild extrinsics from agent metadata
- Led to agent-specific rebuild logic in executioner
- Registry mismatches between agent API and executioner API

**Decision:**
Agents must create and return complete, ready-to-sign extrinsics.

**Rationale:**
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Agent encapsulates creation logic
2. **Scalability**: Executioner stays generic, works with any agent
3. **Correctness**: Extrinsic uses correct API registry from start
4. **Simplicity**: Executioner code reduced by 73%

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. ❌ **Metadata approach**: Agent returns metadata, executioner rebuilds
   - Problem: Executioner needs agent-specific logic
   - Problem: Doesn't scale to multiple agents
   - Problem: Registry mismatches
   
2. ✅ **Extrinsic approach**: Agent returns ready-to-sign extrinsic
   - Clean separation
   - Scalable to unlimited agents
   - Correct by construction

**Consequences:**
- Agents must have access to correct API instance (session API)
- Agents are responsible for production-safe extrinsic creation
- Executioner is simple and generic

**Code Comparison:**

Before (Metadata Approach):
```typescript
// Agent (200 lines)
async transfer(params) {
  // Validate
  return { metadata: { amount, recipient, ... } };
}

// Executioner (500 lines of agent-specific logic)
async execute(item) {
  // Create session
  // Rebuild extrinsic from metadata
  // Manual address encoding
  // Manual method selection
  // Registry validation
  // Then: simulate, sign, broadcast
}
```

After (Extrinsic Approach):
```typescript
// Agent (200 lines)
async transfer(params) {
  // Validate
  // Detect capabilities
  // Create production-safe extrinsic
  return { extrinsic: readyToSign };
}

// Executioner (150 lines, generic)
async execute(item) {
  // Extrinsic already perfect!
  // Just: simulate, sign, broadcast
}
```

(Updated: January 2026, see ARCHITECTURE_REVERSION_COMPLETE.md)

### Decision 3: Optional Chopsticks Simulation Before Execution

**Context:**
- Users can't predict if transaction will succeed
- Failed transactions waste fees
- Some errors only appear during runtime execution
- Simulation adds latency (1-3 seconds) which may not always be desired

**Decision:**
Simulation is **optional** and can be enabled/disabled. When enabled, all extrinsics are simulated with Chopsticks before signing. When disabled, execution proceeds directly to signing. Execution items initialize with status based on simulation setting (`'pending'` when enabled, `'ready'` when disabled).

**Rationale:**
1. **Error Prevention**: Catch failures before spending fees (when enabled)
2. **User Confidence**: Show balance changes preview (when enabled)
3. **Better UX**: Explain why transaction would fail (when enabled)
4. **Flexibility**: Can be disabled for speed or when simulation infrastructure unavailable
5. **Status-Aware Initialization**: UI correctly reflects execution flow based on simulation setting

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. ❌ **Always simulate**: Required simulation for all transactions
   - Problem: Adds latency even when not needed
   - Problem: Requires Chopsticks infrastructure always available
   
2. ❌ **No simulation**: Just send transactions and hope
   - Poor UX
   - Wasted fees on failures
   
3. ❌ **RPC dry-run only**: Use `paymentInfo()` or `dryRun()`
   - Doesn't actually execute runtime logic
   - Misses balance/permission issues
   
4. ✅ **Optional Chopsticks simulation**: Real runtime execution locally (when enabled)
   - Most accurate when enabled
   - Shows actual balance changes when enabled
   - Falls back to dry-run if Chopsticks unavailable
   - Can be disabled for speed
   - Status initialization adapts to simulation setting

**Consequences:**
- **When enabled**: Requires Chopsticks dependency, adds latency (1-3 seconds), greatly improves UX, reduces failed transactions
- **When disabled**: Faster execution, no simulation infrastructure needed, items start as `'ready'` instead of `'pending'`
- **Status Flow**: Items initialize with `'pending'` status when simulation enabled (will be simulated), `'ready'` when disabled (ready for signing)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Simulation control (executionSimulator.ts)
export function shouldSimulate(): boolean {
  return false;  // Toggle to enable/disable
}

// Status-aware initialization (executionArray.ts, utils.ts)
const initialStatus = shouldSimulate() ? 'pending' : 'ready';

// Execution flow (executioner.ts)
if (shouldSimulate()) {
  await runSimulation(extrinsic, context, executionArray, item);
} else {
  executionArray.updateStatus(item.id, 'ready');
}
```

**History:**
- v0.2.0 (PR #49, January 2026): Made simulation optional with status-aware initialization
- v0.1.0 (January 2026): Initial implementation (simulation always attempted)

---

### Decision 4: Multi-Endpoint RPC Management

**Context:**
- Public RPC endpoints have reliability issues
- Single endpoint can go down or rate-limit
- Users face "connection failed" errors

**Decision:**
Use RpcManager with multiple endpoints, health monitoring, and automatic failover.

**Rationale:**
1. **Reliability**: Automatic failover to healthy endpoints
2. **Performance**: Use fastest available endpoint
3. **User Experience**: Seamless connection handling
4. **Production-Ready**: Handle real-world RPC issues

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. ❌ **Single endpoint**: Hard-code one RPC URL
   - Single point of failure
   - Rate limiting issues
   
2. ❌ **User-provided endpoint**: Let user choose
   - Poor UX
   - Most users don't know good endpoints
   
3. ✅ **Multi-endpoint manager**: Smart endpoint selection
   - Handles failures gracefully
   - Optimal performance
   - Better UX

**Consequences:**
- More complex connection logic
- Health monitoring overhead (minimal)
- Significantly improved reliability

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const manager = new RpcManager([
  'wss://rpc.polkadot.io',
  'wss://polkadot-rpc.dwellir.com',
  'wss://polkadot.api.onfinality.io/public-ws'
]);

const api = await manager.getReadApi();  // Uses best available endpoint
```

(Updated: January 2026)

### Decision 5: Pluggable Signer Architecture

**Context:**
- Browser wallets (Talisman, SubWallet) use injected signers
- Testing requires programmatic signing
- Backend/automation needs different signing methods

**Decision:**
Create Signer interface with multiple implementations.

**Rationale:**
1. **Environment Flexibility**: Works in browser, terminal, backend
2. **Testability**: Mock signers for tests
3. **Extensibility**: Custom signing workflows
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy browser integration still works

**Alternatives Considered:**
1. ❌ **Browser-only**: Hard-code browser wallet integration
   - Can't test without browser
   - Can't automate
   
2. ❌ **Keyring-only**: Use Polkadot-js keyring everywhere
   - Can't use browser wallets
   - Poor security (exposes private keys)
   
3. ✅ **Pluggable signers**: Interface with multiple implementations
   - Works everywhere
   - Testable
   - Extensible

**Consequences:**
- Signer must be passed to executioner
- Each environment needs appropriate signer implementation
- Cleaner architecture

**Implementation:**
```typescript
interface Signer {
  sign(extrinsic: SubmittableExtrinsic, address: string): Promise<Uint8Array>;
}

// Browser
const signer = new BrowserWalletSigner(walletExtension);

// Testing
const signer = new KeyringSigner(keyring.addFromUri('//Alice'));

// Custom
class CustomSigner implements Signer { ... }
```

(Updated: January 2026)

---

### Decision 6: Environment System (Mainnet/Testnet)

**Context:**
- Users need clear separation between production (mainnet) and testing (testnet) environments
- Chat instances should be isolated by environment to prevent accidental cross-environment operations
- UI needs to clearly indicate which environment is active
- Users should be able to switch environments easily
- Chat history should be searchable and filterable by environment

**Decision:**
Implement an environment system with:
1. `Environment` type: `'mainnet' | 'testnet'` (extensible for future environments)
2. Environment-bound chat instances (immutable environment binding)
3. Environment-aware UI components (EnvironmentBadge, EnvironmentSwitch)
4. Chat history with environment filtering
5. Automatic environment validation when switching networks

**Rationale:**
1. **Safety**: Prevents accidental testnet operations on mainnet
2. **Clarity**: Users always know which environment they're using
3. **Isolation**: Chat instances cannot mix environments
4. **UX**: Easy switching between environments with clear visual indicators
5. **Future-Proof**: Extensible to additional environments (devnet, etc.)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
type Environment = 'mainnet' | 'testnet';

// Chat instances bound to environment
class ChatInstance {
  readonly environment: Environment;  // Immutable
  readonly network: Network;          // Mutable within environment
}

// Environment validation
const ENVIRONMENT_NETWORKS: Record<Environment, Network[]> = {
  mainnet: ['polkadot', 'kusama'],
  testnet: ['westend']
};

// UI components
<EnvironmentBadge environment={dotbot.getEnvironment()} />
<EnvironmentSwitch 
  currentEnvironment={dotbot.getEnvironment()}
  onSwitch={async (env) => await dotbot.switchEnvironment(env)}
/>
```

**Consequences:**
- **Breaking**: Chat instances are now environment-bound (cannot change)
- **Feature**: Environment switching creates new chat instance
- **Feature**: Chat history can filter by environment
- **UI**: Clear visual indicators for current environment
- **Safety**: Prevents cross-environment operations

**History:**
- v0.2.0 (PR #44, #45, #46, January 2026): Initial environment system implementation
- v0.1.0: No environment concept (mainnet only)

---

### Decision 7: Multi-Network Architecture

**Context:**
- DotBot initially focused solely on Polkadot mainnet
- Users need testnet (Westend) support for safe experimentation
- Kusama support desired for complete ecosystem coverage
- Different networks have different characteristics (tokens, parachains, DEXes)
- LLM needs network-specific context to provide accurate responses

**Decision:**
Implement a comprehensive multi-network infrastructure with:
1. Type-safe network identifiers (`Network` type)
2. Centralized network metadata (`NETWORK_CONFIG`)
3. Network-aware RPC management
4. Network-specific knowledge bases for LLM context
5. Utility functions for network operations

**Rationale:**

1. **Type Safety**: Union type `'polkadot' | 'kusama' | 'westend'` provides compile-time safety
2. **Centralized Configuration**: Single source of truth for network properties
3. **LLM Context Quality**: Network-specific knowledge improves response accuracy
4. **Maintainability**: Easy to add new networks or update existing ones
5. **User Experience**: Seamless switching between networks with correct context

**Architecture Layers:**

**Layer 1: Type System**
```typescript
// Core network type
export type Network = 'polkadot' | 'kusama' | 'westend';

// Comprehensive network metadata
export interface NetworkMetadata {
  name: string;
  network: Network;
  token: string;
  decimals: number;
  ss58Format: number;
  relayChainEndpoints: string[];
  assetHubEndpoints: string[];
  isTestnet: boolean;
  color: string;
}

// Centralized configuration
export const NETWORK_CONFIG: Record<Network, NetworkMetadata> = {
  polkadot: { name: 'Polkadot', token: 'DOT', decimals: 10, ... },
  kusama: { name: 'Kusama', token: 'KSM', decimals: 12, ... },
  westend: { name: 'Westend', token: 'WND', decimals: 12, isTestnet: true, ... }
};
```

**Layer 2: RPC Management**
- Network-specific RPC managers via factory functions
- Storage isolation per network (health tracking)
- Pre-configured endpoint lists

```typescript
// Factory function for network-specific managers
const managers = createRpcManagersForNetwork('westend');
// Returns: { relayChainManager, assetHubManager }

// Network-specific factories
const relayManager = createWestendRelayChainManager();
const assetHubManager = createWestendAssetHubManager();
```

**Layer 3: Knowledge Base System**
- Separate knowledge files per network (e.g., `dotKnowledge.ts`, `westendKnowledge.ts`)
- Network-specific information (parachains, DEXes, tokens, fees)
- Dynamic loading based on selected network
- Formatted for LLM context injection

```typescript
const knowledge = getKnowledgeBaseForNetwork('westend');
const formatted = formatKnowledgeBaseForNetwork('westend');
// Returns: String formatted for LLM system prompt
```

**Layer 4: DotBot Core Integration**
```typescript
const dotbot = await DotBot.create({
  wallet: account,
  network: 'westend',  // Network parameter
  relayChainManager,
  assetHubManager
});

// DotBot automatically:
// - Uses correct token symbol (WND)
// - Includes Westend knowledge in LLM context
// - Sets testnet flag in system prompt
```

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. ❌ **String-based network IDs without types**
   - Problem: No compile-time safety
   - Problem: Typos cause runtime errors
   - Problem: No IDE autocomplete

2. ❌ **Scattered configuration across codebase**
   - Problem: Hard to maintain
   - Problem: Inconsistencies
   - Problem: Difficult to add new networks

3. ❌ **Single generic knowledge base for all networks**
   - Problem: Bloated LLM context
   - Problem: Inaccurate information (wrong parachains/DEXes)
   - Problem: Confusing responses (mentions Kusama when on Westend)

4. ✅ **Centralized, type-safe, network-specific system**
   - Type safety prevents errors
   - Easy to maintain and extend
   - Optimal LLM context per network
   - Clear separation of concerns

**Consequences:**

✅ **Benefits:**
- Type-safe network handling throughout codebase
- Single source of truth for network configuration
- LLM receives accurate, network-specific context
- Easy to add Kusama or future networks
- Better user experience with correct symbols/balances
- Comprehensive testing (600+ tests)

⚠️ **Trade-offs:**
- Additional abstraction layer (worth it for type safety)
- More test coverage needed per network (already done)
- Knowledge base files need maintenance (but centralized)

**Testing Strategy:**
- 30 tests for network utilities
- 15 tests for multi-network RPC management
- 13 tests for network-aware DotBot core
- All scenarios tested across all networks

**Future Extensions:**

This architecture enables:
1. **Environment-bound chat instances** (mainnet/testnet separation in UI)
2. **Kusama full support** (add `kusamaKnowledge.ts` - infrastructure already complete)
3. **Additional testnets** (Rococo, Paseo) with minimal changes
4. **Network-specific features** (e.g., Kusama canary features)

**Kusama Status:** Infrastructure is complete (RPC endpoints, factory functions, types), but `kusamaKnowledge.ts` needs to be created. Currently falls back to Polkadot knowledge.

**Implementation Files:**
- `frontend/src/lib/prompts/system/knowledge/types.ts` - Type definitions
- `frontend/src/lib/prompts/system/knowledge/networkUtils.ts` - Utilities (20+ functions)
- `frontend/src/lib/prompts/system/knowledge/dotKnowledge.ts` - Polkadot knowledge
- `frontend/src/lib/prompts/system/knowledge/westendKnowledge.ts` - Westend knowledge
- `frontend/src/lib/rpcManager.ts` - Network-aware RPC management
- `frontend/src/lib/dotbot.ts` - Network parameter integration

**Jest Configuration:**
- CRACO setup required for Polkadot.js v14 static class blocks
- Transform patterns configured for `@polkadot` and `@acala-network` packages
- 600+ tests passing across all networks

**Documentation:**
- Complete API reference in `docs/API.md`
- Network utilities documented with examples
- Migration guide for existing integrations

### Decision 8: Chat Instance Architecture

**Context:**
- Initial implementation had execution state (ExecutionArray) as a global singleton in DotBot
- No concept of conversation history or persistence
- Execution flows needed to be part of conversation timeline, not separate
- Testing/production isolation required (mainnet vs testnet)

**Decision:**
Refactor ChatInstance from interface to full class that:
1. Encapsulates conversation history + execution state
2. Is bound to an environment (`'mainnet'` | `'testnet'`)
3. Supports multiple independent ExecutionArrays per conversation
4. Owns its persistence and lifecycle
5. DotBot internalizes ChatInstanceManager (better DX)

**Rationale:**

1. **State Ownership**: Execution state belongs to conversation, not DotBot
2. **Environment Isolation**: Prevents mixing testnet/mainnet operations
3. **Multiple Flows**: Users can have multiple transactions in-progress in one chat
4. **Temporal Ordering**: Execution flows appear inline with messages (user message → plan → ExecutionFlow → result)
5. **Developer Experience**: DotBot users don't need to manage ChatInstanceManager manually

**Key Changes:**

**Before (v0.1.0):**
```typescript
// DotBot owned execution state
class DotBot {
  private currentExecutionArray: ExecutionArray | null;
  
  async chat(message) {
    // ... LLM response
    // Auto-executes immediately
    this.currentExecutionArray = await this.execute(plan);
  }
}

// No conversation history
// No persistence
// No environment isolation
```

**After (v0.2.0):**
```typescript
// ChatInstance owns execution state
class ChatInstance {
  environment: Environment;
  messages: ConversationItem[];  // Mixed: text + executions
  private executionArrays: Map<string, ExecutionArray>;
  
  addExecutionMessage(state: ExecutionArrayState) { ... }
  setExecutionArray(id: string, array: ExecutionArray) { ... }
  onExecutionUpdate(id: string, callback) { ... }
}

// DotBot delegates to ChatInstance
class DotBot {
  private chatManager: ChatInstanceManager;
  public currentChat: ChatInstance | null;
  
  async chat(message) {
    // ... LLM response
    await this.prepareExecution(plan);  // Adds to chat, doesn't execute
    // User clicks "Accept & Start" → startExecution(executionId)
  }
  
  async switchEnvironment(env: Environment) {
    // Creates new ChatInstance for new environment
  }
}
```

**Two-Step Execution Pattern:**
```typescript
// Step 1: Prepare (after LLM response)
await dotbot.prepareExecution(plan);
// → Orchestrates, adds ExecutionMessage to chat
// → UI shows ExecutionFlow for review

// Step 2: Execute (when user approves)
await dotbot.startExecution(executionMessage.executionId);
// → Executes specific flow by ID
```

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. ❌ **Global execution state in DotBot**
   - Can't support multiple flows
   - No environment isolation
   - Doesn't scale to chat history UI

2. ❌ **Separate ExecutionManager**
   - Splits conversation from execution (artificial separation)
   - Hard to maintain temporal ordering
   - Extra complexity for developers

3. ✅ **ChatInstance owns execution**
   - Natural ownership model
   - Temporal ordering built-in
   - Environment isolation automatic
   - Clean developer API

**Consequences:**
- **Breaking**: Removed `onExecutionArrayUpdate()` → use `chat.onExecutionUpdate(id, callback)`
- **Breaking**: Removed `executeWithArrayTracking()` → use `prepareExecution()` + `startExecution(id)`
- **Breaking**: Renamed `ChatMessage` → `ConversationItem` (better reflects mixed content)
- **Breaking**: Renamed `ChatInstance` interface → `ChatInstanceData`
- **Feature**: Multiple execution flows per conversation
- **Feature**: Environment-bound chat instances
- **Feature**: User approval before execution (better UX, safer)
- **DX**: Developers import less, DotBot manages more internally

**Implementation Highlights:**

1. **Unique IDs everywhere:**
   - `ExecutionArray` generates unique ID
   - `ExecutionMessage` stores `executionId`
   - Enables tracking and interaction with specific flows

2. **ConversationItem type:**
   ```typescript
   type ConversationItem = 
     | TextMessage 
     | ExecutionMessage 
     | SystemMessage 
     | KnowledgeRequestMessage 
     | /* ... */;
   ```
   - Union type for all conversation elements
   - UI maps over `conversationItems` and renders appropriately

3. **Storage abstraction ready:**
   - `ChatInstanceManager` uses `IChatStorage` interface
   - Default: `LocalStorageChatStorage`
   - Ready for: `ApiChatStorage` (external DB)

(Added: January 2026)

### Decision 9: Storage Abstraction and GDPR Compliance

**Context:**
- Chat instances need persistence (localStorage initially)
- Future requirement: external database for multi-device sync
- We take privacy, data portability seriously
- Storage backend might change (localStorage → API → hybrid)
- Need auditable data management

**Decision:**
Implement:
1. Storage abstraction layer (`IChatStorage` interface)
2. GDPR-compliant `DataManager` class
3. Centralized storage key management (`STORAGE_KEYS` enum)
4. Async-first API (ready for network requests)

**Rationale:**

1. **Future-Proof**: Easy to switch from localStorage to external DB
3. **Testability**: Can mock storage in tests
4. **Auditability**: Centralized data operations
5. **Privacy-First**: Users control their data

**Architecture:**

**Storage Abstraction:**
```typescript
interface IChatStorage {
  loadAll(): Promise<ChatInstanceData[]>;
  load(id: string): Promise<ChatInstanceData | null>;
  save(instance: ChatInstanceData): Promise<void>;
  delete(id: string): Promise<void>;
  clear(): Promise<void>;
  isAvailable(): Promise<boolean>;
  getType(): string;
}

// Implementations
class LocalStorageChatStorage implements IChatStorage { ... }
class ApiChatStorage implements IChatStorage { ... }
class HybridChatStorage implements IChatStorage { ... }

// Factory
const storage = createChatStorage({ 
  type: 'local',  // or 'api', 'hybrid'
  apiUrl: 'https://...'
});
```

**GDPR Operations:**
```typescript
class DataManager {
  // Export all data (right to data portability)
  async exportAllData(): Promise<DataExport> {
    return {
      chatInstances: [...],
      rpcHealth: [...],
      userPreferences: { ... },
      walletCache: { ... },
      metadata: { exportedAt, version }
    };
  }
  
  // Delete all data (right to erasure)
  async nukeAllData(): Promise<DeletionReport> {
    // Deletes ALL storage keys
    // Returns verification report
  }
  
  // Verify complete deletion
  async verifyDataCleared(): Promise<boolean> {
    // Confirms no DotBot data remains
  }
  
  // Granular deletion
  async deleteChatData(): Promise<number>;
  async deleteRpcHealthData(): Promise<number>;
  async deletePreferences(): Promise<boolean>;
  async deleteWalletCache(): Promise<boolean>;
}

// Global convenience
await nukeAllData();
await exportAndDownload('dotbot-data.json');
```

**Centralized Keys:**
```typescript
export const STORAGE_KEYS = {
  CHAT_INSTANCES: 'dotbot_chat_instances',
  RPC_HEALTH_POLKADOT_RELAY: 'rpc_health_polkadot_relay',
  RPC_HEALTH_POLKADOT_ASSETHUB: 'rpc_health_polkadot_assethub',
  // ... all storage keys enumerated
} as const;
```

**Alternatives Considered:**

1. ❌ **Direct localStorage calls throughout codebase**
   - Hard to switch backends
   - No GDPR compliance
   - Can't mock for testing

2. ❌ **Simple wrapper around localStorage**
   - Not async (can't add API later)
   - No interface (can't swap implementations)

3. ✅ **Full abstraction + GDPR module**
   - Future-proof
   - Compliant
   - Testable
   - Professional

**Consequences:**
- **Feature**: All storage operations async (ready for network)
- **Feature**: Complete GDPR compliance
- **Feature**: Easy storage backend switching
- **Feature**: Granular data deletion
- **Complexity**: More abstraction layers
- **Benefit**: Professional-grade data management
- **Benefit**: Users can export/delete all data easily

**GDPR Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Right to erasure (`nukeAllData()`)
- ✅ Right to data portability (`exportAllData()`)
- ✅ Transparent data collection (enumerated keys)
- ✅ Complete deletion verification
- ✅ Granular deletion control

### Key Data Structures

**AgentResult** (Agent → Executioner):
```typescript
interface AgentResult {
  description: string;
  extrinsic: SubmittableExtrinsic<'promise'>;
  estimatedFee?: string;
  warnings?: string[];
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  resultType: 'extrinsic' | 'data';
  requiresConfirmation: boolean;
  executionType: 'extrinsic' | 'data_fetch';
}
```

**ExecutionResult** (Executioner → User):
```typescript
interface ExecutionResult {
  success: boolean;
  blockHash?: string;
  txHash?: string;
  events?: any[];
  error?: string;
  errorCode?: string;
}
```

### Network-Aware Data Flow

**Network Selection Flow:**
```
1. Application initializes with network parameter ('polkadot', 'kusama', or 'westend')
   ↓
2. Factory creates network-specific RPC managers
   ├─ createRpcManagersForNetwork(network)
   ├─ Returns { relayChainManager, assetHubManager }
   └─ Each manager has network-scoped storage
   ↓
3. DotBot.create() receives network parameter
   ├─ Loads network-specific knowledge base
   ├─ Formats knowledge for LLM context
   └─ Sets network-aware flags (isTestnet, token symbol)
   ↓
4. During chat interactions
   ├─ System prompt includes network-specific knowledge
   ├─ Balance displays use correct token symbol
   └─ Operations use correct RPC endpoints
```

**Network Detection Flow:**
```
Connected to unknown chain
   ↓
detectNetworkFromChainName(chainName)
   ├─ Checks chain metadata
   ├─ Matches against known patterns
   └─ Returns Network type
   ↓
getNetworkMetadata(network)
   └─ Provides all configuration
```

---

## Conventions

### Code Style

1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All code uses strict TypeScript
2. **Explicit Types**: No implicit `any` (use `unknown` instead)
3. **Error Handling**: Custom error classes (AgentError, SimulationError, etc.)
4. **Async/Await**: Prefer async/await over Promise chains

### Naming Conventions

1. **Classes**: PascalCase (`AssetTransferAgent`, `Executioner`)
2. **Functions**: camelCase (`buildSafeTransferExtrinsic`, `detectCapabilities`)
3. **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_BATCH_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`)
4. **Files**: camelCase for utilities, PascalCase for classes

### Agent Development

When creating a new agent:

1. **Extend BaseAgent**: Reuse common functionality
2. **Create Extrinsics**: Agent must return ready-to-sign extrinsic
3. **Detect Capabilities**: Use runtime introspection
4. **Handle Errors**: Use AgentError with error codes
5. **Dry Run**: Optionally validate with Chopsticks
6. **Document**: JSDoc for all public methods

**Template:**
```typescript
export class MyNewAgent extends BaseAgent {
  getAgentName(): string {
    return 'MyNewAgent';
  }

  async myOperation(params: MyParams): Promise<AgentResult> {
    this.ensureInitialized();
    
    // 1. Validate input
    this.validateAddress(params.address);
    
    // 2. Detect capabilities
    const capabilities = await detectMyCapabilities(this.api);
    
    // 3. Create extrinsic
    const extrinsic = buildMyExtrinsic(this.api, params, capabilities);
    
    // 4. Optional: Dry run
    await this.dryRunExtrinsic(extrinsic, params.address);
    
    // 5. Return result
    return this.createResult(
      'Human-readable description',
      extrinsic,
      { estimatedFee: '...' }
    );
  }
}
```

### Error Handling

**Custom Error Classes:**
```typescript
class AgentError extends Error {
  code: string;
  details?: any;
  
  constructor(message: string, code: string, details?: any) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'AgentError';
    this.code = code;
    this.details = details;
  }
}
```

**Error Codes:**
- `NOT_INITIALIZED`: Agent not initialized
- `INVALID_ADDRESS`: Address validation failed
- `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`: Not enough funds
- `CAPABILITY_NOT_SUPPORTED`: Runtime missing required method
- `SIMULATION_FAILED`: Chopsticks simulation failed
- `SIGNING_REJECTED`: User rejected transaction
- `BROADCAST_FAILED`: Network submission failed

---

## Dependencies

### Core Dependencies

**Polkadot.js API** (`@polkadot/api`)
- Purpose: Blockchain interaction
- Why: Industry standard, well-maintained
- Version: Latest stable

**Polkadot.js Util** (`@polkadot/util`, `@polkadot/util-crypto`)
- Purpose: Address encoding, BN math, cryptography
- Why: Polkadot-native utilities

**Chopsticks** (`@acala-network/chopsticks`)
- Purpose: Runtime simulation
- Why: Most accurate pre-execution validation
- Optional: Falls back to dry-run if unavailable

### Design Rationale

1. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only essential libraries
2. **No Framework Lock-in**: Core logic is framework-agnostic
3. **Production-Tested**: All dependencies widely used in Polkadot ecosystem
4. **Type Safety**: All dependencies have TypeScript support

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Agents:**
- Test extrinsic creation
- Mock API responses
- Verify capability detection
- Test error handling

**Execution Engine:**
- Mock agents
- Test simulation flow
- Test signing flow
- Test broadcasting flow

### Integration Tests

- Real RPC connections
- Chopsticks simulation
- End-to-end transaction flow (on testnet)

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Single transfer (Relay Chain)
- [ ] Single transfer (Asset Hub)
- [ ] Batch transfer
- [ ] Insufficient balance error
- [ ] Invalid address error
- [ ] Simulation failure
- [ ] User rejection
- [ ] Network failure

---

## Performance Considerations

### RPC Calls Optimization

1. **Connection Reuse**: Single API instance per chain
2. **Capability Caching**: Detect once, reuse
3. **Batch Queries**: Use `api.queryMulti()` when possible

### Memory Management

1. **API Cleanup**: Disconnect when done
2. **Event Listener Cleanup**: Unsubscribe after monitoring
3. **Extrinsic Disposal**: Don't hold references after execution

### User Experience

1. **Optimistic UI**: Show pending state immediately
2. **Background Monitoring**: Don't block UI during finalization
3. **Progress Feedback**: Update user on each execution phase

---

## Future Considerations

### Planned Improvements

1. **Agent Registry**: Dynamic agent discovery and loading
2. **Parallel Execution**: Execute independent operations concurrently
3. **Transaction Batching**: Combine multiple user operations
4. **XCM Support**: Cross-chain transfers
5. **Multi-Signature**: Complex authorization workflows

### Potential Challenges

1. **Runtime Upgrades**: Method deprecations, new features
2. **Chain Diversity**: Different parachains have different capabilities
3. **XCM Complexity**: Cross-chain operations are complex
4. **Performance**: Simulation adds latency

### Decision 10: Two-Step Execution Pattern

**Context:**
- Initial implementation auto-executed transactions immediately after LLM response
- Users had no opportunity to review transactions before signing
- Execution state was global in DotBot, preventing multiple concurrent flows
- No way to resume interrupted execution flows

**Decision:**
Implement two-step execution pattern:
1. **Prepare**: `prepareExecution(plan)` - Orchestrates plan, adds ExecutionMessage to chat, shows UI for review
2. **Execute**: `startExecution(executionId)` - Executes when user clicks "Accept & Start"

**Rationale:**
1. **User Safety**: Users can review transactions before signing
2. **Better UX**: Clear separation between planning and execution
3. **Multiple Flows**: Supports multiple independent execution flows per conversation
4. **Resumable**: Interrupted flows can be rebuilt and resumed
5. **State Ownership**: Execution state belongs to ChatInstance, not DotBot

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Step 1: Prepare (automatic after LLM response)
await dotbot.prepareExecution(plan);
// → Orchestrates ExecutionPlan → ExecutionArray
// → Adds ExecutionMessage to chat timeline
// → UI shows ExecutionFlow component with "Accept & Start" button

// Step 2: Execute (user-triggered)
await dotbot.startExecution(executionMessage.executionId);
// → Executes specific ExecutionArray by ID
// → Updates ExecutionMessage in chat as execution progresses
```

**Breaking Changes:**
- ⚠️ **Removed**: `executeWithArrayTracking()` → use `prepareExecution()` + `startExecution(id)`
- ⚠️ **Removed**: `onExecutionArrayUpdate()` → use `chat.onExecutionUpdate(id, callback)`
- ⚠️ **Removed**: `currentExecutionArray` property → use `chat.getExecutionArray(id)`
- ⚠️ **Changed**: `chat()` no longer auto-executes → returns `executed: false`, user must approve

**Consequences:**
- **Breaking**: Existing code using removed methods must migrate
- **Feature**: User approval required before execution
- **Feature**: Multiple execution flows per conversation
- **Feature**: Execution flows can be resumed after interruption
- **DX**: Cleaner API, better separation of concerns

**History:**
- v0.2.0 (PR #44, #45, January 2026): Two-step execution pattern introduced
- v0.1.0: Auto-execution immediately after LLM response
